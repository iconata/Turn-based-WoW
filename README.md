# Turn-based WoW
This is a simple turn based terminal game, based on World of Warcraft.

The game has:
- 6 classes to choose from - Paladin, Warrior, Priest, Monk, Mage, Shaman
- 4 roles for the classes - Ranged DPS, Healer, Melee DPS, Tank
- The ability to read the input from terminal (to be implemented)
- Turn-based play style (to be implemented)

I'm planning to add in a future update:
- UI
- More complex actions like the ability to enter a combo (for example, combo of 4 moves - Crusader Strike, Judgement, Blade of Justice, Templar Strike)


I'm doing this as a hobby and a learning opportunity.
